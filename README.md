## About Me
I love Digital Media and learning new things, but man am I bad at time management.

## Past Coding Experience
I took a class a long time ago introducing me to HTML and CSS to make a basic HTML/CSS website. When I was working on my Bachelors, I used C# to code small Unity games. (I was not great at these tasks, but I'm also not clueless either)

## Career Goals
1. Teach Digital Media
2. Challenge myself 
3. Learn new things, no matter how tough it might be. Don't stay comfortable.
